Explore the three learning algorithms we've produced to understand which hyperparameters
 (and what ranges of their values) lead to bias errors and which lead to variance errors on 
 the Adult data set.

To do this, create plots showing training and validation set errors (no cross validation) on the y-axis and
 various values of the hyperparameter you are exploring on the x-axis.

 Handin:

For each of the following produce a chart and a ~2 sentence analysis of where there is underfitting and overfitting occuring.
  Make sure to compare across algorithms when identifying bias and variance issues.

 1 Point - A chart exploring the rounds hyperparamter in BoostedTrees with maxDepth set to 1.
