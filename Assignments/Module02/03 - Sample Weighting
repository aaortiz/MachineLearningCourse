Add sample weighting to your decision tree code. SupportCode\Framework-3-SampleWeighting.py has some
  tests that may help.


1) in the entropy calculation
2) in the weighting across partitions when computing information gain
3) when spliting data into subsets, also split the weights
4) in predicting, each sample in the leaf vote is scaled by its weight


There is nothing to hand in here, but if you don't carefully check your work you will have 
 are really tough time with the next assignment, boosting.
