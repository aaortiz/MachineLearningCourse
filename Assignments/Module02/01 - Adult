Load the supporting code: SupportCode\Framwork-1-Adult.py

Inspect the data a little bit. Skim the Featurize code - this data set has categorical
 and numeric features. The code uses 'one-hot' encoding to turn the categorical features into binary
 features.

Adapt the code you used to tune your SMS Spam model in Module01. Do a quick tuning run on the adult data using just the
 categorical features (not the numeric ones):
   
    featurizer.CreateFeatureSet(xTrainRaw, yTrain, useCategoricalFeatures = True, useNumericFeatures = False)

1) There are only two parameters to tune at this point (stepSize and convergence)
2) Don't do extensive search, just a quick sweep over the two hyperparameters to get oriented

Get familar with the code you wrote to do the sweeps -- you'll use variations of it a few more times.

HAND IN - 

1 point   - A figure for each hyperparameter showing the cross validation accuracy on y (with 50% 2-sided error bars) and the parameter value on x.
0.5 point - A few sentences describing the best hyperparameter setting you found and the estimated accuracy range. Is your model
                better than predicting the most common class? How much? (be precise)
